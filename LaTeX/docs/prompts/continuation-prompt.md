# Resume Tagging System Continuation

## Context 
We've been developing a Git-based resume tagging system to efficiently manage and compare multiple resume versions. So far, we have:

1. Created a PowerShell extraction script (`extract_cv_resume.ps1`) to pull TeX files from CurriculumVitae and Resume directories
2. Developed a Cursor prompt to analyze and encode content differences
3. Created an encoding management system with JSON storage
4. Designed a visualization tool for comparing resume versions
5. Added HTML report generation for visual comparisons

## Current Architecture
- **Directories**: CurriculumVitae/ and Resume/ contain TeX files directly (no subdirectories)
- **Analysis**: Compares CV and Resume files from the same branch
- **Storage**: Full JSON encodings stored in a central repository
- **Organization**: Git branches named `resume/[focus]_[company]_[date]`
- **File Management**: PowerShell scripts for extraction and management

## Next Steps
Based on our discussion, we need to enhance the system with:

1. **Job Description Metadata**: Add tracking for job descriptions that each resume was tailored for
2. **Automatic Report Generation**: Integrate HTML report generation into the encoding save process
3. **Web Interface**: Create a simple browser interface to browse and compare encodings

## Attached Files
Please attach the following files to this conversation:

1. `extract_cv_resume.ps1` - The PowerShell extraction script
2. `html-report-generator.ps1` - The HTML report generation script 
3. `manage_encodings.ps1` - The encoding management script
4. `resume_visualization.html` - The visualization tool

## Instructions
1. Copy this entire prompt into a new conversation with Claude
2. Attach the four files listed above to the conversation
3. Specify which feature you'd like to implement first:
   - "Implement job description metadata tracking"
   - "Integrate automatic HTML report generation"
   - "Create a simple web interface for browsing encodings"

## Additional Notes
- The system is designed to handle dozens of resume versions
- The primary focus is on accurate content comparison and efficient resume selection
- All encodings should remain as full JSON for maximum flexibility
- Any web interface should be simple and self-contained (no external dependencies)
- Report generation should work seamlessly with the existing organization structure
