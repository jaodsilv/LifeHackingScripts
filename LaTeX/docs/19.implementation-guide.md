# Automatic HTML Report Generation - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The automatic HTML report generation feature enhances your resume management system by providing visual comparisons between resume versions with rich metrics and insights. The system automatically detects significant changes, integrates job description data, and maintains an organized report index for easy navigation.

## Components Implemented

1. **report-manager.ps1** - PowerShell script for managing reports
2. **Updated html-report-generator.ps1** - Enhanced to support automatic generation
3. **Updated manage_encodings.ps1** - Integrated with report generation pipeline
4. **report_template.html** - Modern template with JD alignment visualization
5. **reports_index.html** - Web interface for browsing and filtering reports

## Installation

Place these files in your project structure:

```
/analysis/
  /reports/
    /comparisons/        # For comparison reports
    /timelines/          # For timeline reports
    /jd_matches/         # For JD-focused reports
    reports_index.json   # Report metadata index
    index.html           # Generated from reports_index.html template
  /templates/
    report_template.html
    timeline_template.html
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Save Resume Encodings with Auto-Reporting

When saving a new encoding, you can automatically generate a comparison report:

```powershell
.\manage_encodings.ps1 -Action save -BranchName "resume/data_engineer_2023q4" -AutoReport
```

With job description alignment:

```powershell
.\manage_encodings.ps1 -Action save -BranchName "resume/data_engineer_2023q4" -JdId "examplecorp_seniordata_20231001" -SetPrimary -AutoReport
```

View the report immediately after generation:

```powershell
.\manage_encodings.ps1 -Action save -BranchName "resume/data_engineer_2023q4" -AutoReport -ViewReport
```

### 2. Manage Reports Directly

List all reports:

```powershell
.\report-manager.ps1 -Action list
```

Clean up old reports:

```powershell
.\report-manager.ps1 -Action cleanup -RetentionDays 90
```

Regenerate reports for a branch:

```powershell
.\report-manager.ps1 -Action regenerate -Branch "resume/data_engineer_2023q4"
```

Generate a timeline view for a branch's evolution:

```powershell
.\report-manager.ps1 -Action timeline -Branch "resume/data_engineer_2023q4"
```

Rebuild the report index:

```powershell
.\report-manager.ps1 -Action index
```

### 3. Generate Reports Manually

Generate comparison against main branch:

```powershell
.\html-report-generator.ps1 -Branches "resume/data_engineer_2023q4" -CompareToMain
```

Compare two specific branches:

```powershell
.\html-report-generator.ps1 -Branches "resume/data_engineer_2023q4,resume/backend_dev_2023q4"
```

Generate reports for all branches:

```powershell
.\html-report-generator.ps1 -AllBranches -CompareToMain
```

## Significant Change Detection

The system automatically detects significant changes based on the following thresholds:

- Overall score change of 5% or more
- JD alignment change of 10% or more
- Addition or removal of 2 or more tags

When significant changes are detected, they are highlighted in the reports and index.

## Web Interface

The system generates a web-based report index (`analysis/reports/index.html`) that provides:

1. Filterable list of all reports
2. Highlights for significant changes
3. Search functionality
4. Direct access to individual reports

Access this interface by opening `analysis/reports/index.html` in your browser.

## Integration with JD Tracking

This feature builds on the Job Description Tracking feature by:

1. Including JD alignment metrics in reports
2. Visualizing skill gaps identified through JD comparison
3. Tracking improvement in JD alignment over time
4. Highlighting significant changes in JD alignment

## Example Workflow

1. Save a new resume encoding with JD alignment:
   ```powershell
   .\manage_encodings.ps1 -Action save -AutoReport
   ```

2. View generated report with JD alignment visualization

3. Make improvements to resume based on insights

4. Save updated resume and compare changes:
   ```powershell
   .\manage_encodings.ps1 -Action save -AutoReport -ViewReport
   ```

5. Browse all reports via the web interface to track progress

## Customization

- Edit `report_template.html` to customize the report appearance
- Adjust change detection thresholds in `report-manager.ps1`
- Create additional report types by extending `html-report-generator.ps1`

## Next Steps

- Create a simple CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate reports on Git commits
- Add email notifications for significant changes
- Create custom report types for specific resume sections
