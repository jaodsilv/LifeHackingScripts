# Resume Tagging System: Updates Summary

## Directory Structure Clarification

We've updated the system to accurately reflect your repository structure:

- ~~Resume\resume\1.Summary.tex~~ → **Resume\1.Summary.tex**
- ~~CurriculumVitae\cv\1.Summary.tex~~ → **CurriculumVitae\1.Summary.tex**

The files are stored directly in the CurriculumVitae and Resume directories, with no subdirectories.

## Added main.tex Analysis

We've incorporated analysis of the main.tex file which contains important aliases:

- Added `main.tex` to the file list in the extraction script
- Updated the Cursor prompt to analyze and compare main.tex content
- Added main.tex to the radar chart visualization
- Added detailed scoring for aliases and configurations in main.tex

## Key Components Updated

1. **Extract CV and Resume Files (PowerShell)**
   - Updated file paths to match actual directory structure
   - Added main.tex to the file extraction list
   - Enhanced error handling for missing files
   - Added branch metadata recording

2. **Cursor Analysis Prompt**
   - Added instructions for analyzing main.tex with aliases
   - Updated expected JSON output format to include main.tex metrics
   - Added specific guidance for comparing aliases and configurations
   - Maintained the lower weight (0.5) for Interests section

3. **Visualization Tool**
   - Added display of branch information and timestamp
   - Updated radar chart to include main.tex content
   - Enhanced the display of metrics and focus tags
   - Maintained all CV augmentation features

4. **Quick Start Guide**
   - Clarified the exact directory structure
   - Listed all files being analyzed (including main.tex)
   - Updated visualization instructions
   - Maintained all workflow steps for branch management

## Implementation Steps

The implementation process remains the same:

1. Create the extraction script (extract_cv_resume.ps1)
2. Create the visualization tool (resume_visualization.html)
3. For each branch:
   - Check out the branch
   - Run the extraction script
   - Use Cursor to analyze the files
   - Visualize the results

## Next Steps

With these updates, the system now:

1. Accurately reflects your repository structure
2. Includes analysis of main.tex with its important aliases
3. Provides comprehensive visualization of all content differences
4. Maintains the focus on 1-to-1 comparison within each branch
5. Preserves the branch-based workflow for resume tailoring

The system is now ready for implementation. You can start by setting up the extraction script and visualization tool, then analyzing your existing resume branch.
