# Resume Tagging Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. **Organize your existing files**
   - Ensure your `CurriculumVitae/` and `Resume/` directories are in the same parent folder
   - Verify that all TeX files are properly named according to your structure

2. **Install and set up Cursor**
   - Download and install Cursor if you haven't already: [https://cursor.sh/](https://cursor.sh/)
   - Create a new workspace that includes both your CV and Resume directories

3. **Create a new directory for encoding output**
   - Create a folder called `ResumeManagement/` to store the encoding output and visualizations

## Step 2: Run Initial Encoding Analysis

1. **Open Cursor and navigate to your workspace**

2. **Create a new file for the encoding prompt**
   - Create a new file called `resume_encoding_prompt.txt`
   - Copy and paste the complete Cursor Implementation Prompt we created into this file

3. **Run the encoding analysis**
   - Select all content in the prompt file
   - Use Cursor's AI features to process the prompt (typically Cmd+K or Ctrl+K)
   - Wait for Cursor to analyze all the files and generate the encoding

4. **Save the generated encoding**
   - Cursor will generate a JSON file with all the encodings
   - Save this as `ResumeManagement/ResumeEncodings.json`

## Step 3: Validate Initial Encoding

1. **Review the encoding output**
   - Open the generated `ResumeEncodings.json` file
   - Check that all your resume versions are properly identified
   - Verify that the section percentages seem accurate
   - Confirm that the focus tags appropriately describe each resume's emphasis

2. **Make manual adjustments if needed**
   - Correct any inaccuracies in the encoding
   - Refine focus tags if they don't precisely capture the resume's emphasis
   - Add any missing information

## Step 4: Reorganize Your Resume Files

1. **Create focus-based directory structure**
   - In your `Resume/` directory, create subdirectories based on primary focus areas
   - Example subdirectories: `Data-Engineering/`, `Backend-Development/`, `Cloud-Infrastructure/`

2. **Rename existing resume files**
   - Adopt the recommended naming convention: `Resume_[PrimaryFocusTag]_[SecondaryFocusTag]_[Company]_[Date]`
   - Example: `Resume_DE_Cloud_MS_2023Q4.tex`
   - Move each file to its appropriate subdirectory

3. **Update references in your build system**
   - If you have a build system or Makefile, update it to reflect the new file locations

## Step 5: Implement Visualization

1. **Set up the visualization tool**
   - Save the visualization HTML file we created to `ResumeManagement/resume_visualization.html`
   - Update the sample data in the script section with your actual resume data from the encoding

2. **Test the visualization**
   - Open the HTML file in a browser
   - Verify that you can select and compare your resume versions
   - Check that the charts and metrics reflect your encoding data

## Step 6: Document Your New System

1. **Create a README file**
   - Document your new resume management system for future reference
   - Include instructions for:
     - How to run the encoding process on new resumes
     - How to use the matching system for new job applications
     - How to perform reverse tailoring
     - How to interpret the visualization

2. **Create a template for new resumes**
   - Create a standard template that follows your established structure
   - Include placeholders for all required sections

## Next Steps

1. **For your first practical use:**
   - Choose a specific job description
   - Use the matching guide to identify the best resume template
   - Tailor that resume for the position
   - Run the reverse tailoring process to update your CV with any new content
   
2. **For ongoing maintenance:**
   - Re-run the encoding analysis whenever you create a new resume version
   - Update the visualization data accordingly
   - Periodically review your CV for consistency and completeness
