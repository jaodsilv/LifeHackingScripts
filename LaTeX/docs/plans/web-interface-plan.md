# Web Interface for Browsing Encodings - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This feature will create a simple, self-contained web interface for browsing and comparing resume encodings. The interface will allow users to:
- View all available resume encodings
- Filter and sort encodings by various criteria
- Compare encodings side-by-side
- Visualize encoding metrics and job description alignment
- Access HTML reports generated by the system

## 2. Component Design

### 2.1. Main Components

1. **Dashboard Interface (`encoding_browser.html`)**
   - Entry point for browsing encodings
   - Lists all available encodings with key metrics
   - Provides filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Links to comparison and detail views

2. **Encoding Detail View (`encoding_detail.html`)**
   - Displays detailed information for a single encoding
   - Visualizes content coverage, skills breakdown
   - Shows job description alignment
   - Provides access to related reports

3. **Comparison View (`encoding_compare.html`)**
   - Side-by-side comparison of two encodings
   - Highlights differences in focus tags, skills
   - Visualizes comparative metrics
   - Direct link to generate/view HTML reports

4. **Shared Components**
   - Navigation header
   - Consistent styling and UI elements
   - Chart and visualization components
   - Common JavaScript utilities

### 2.2. Data Access Layer

1. **Index Loading**
   - Reads `index.json` to get overview of available encodings
   - Self-contained approach using browser file APIs

2. **Encoding Loading**
   - On-demand loading of individual encoding files
   - Caches loaded encodings for performance

3. **Report Integration**
   - Links to existing HTML reports
   - Option to trigger report generation

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1. File Structure

```
/analysis/
  /web/
    /css/
      styles.css
    /js/
      main.js
      utils.js
      charts.js
    encoding_browser.html
    encoding_detail.html
    encoding_compare.html
```

### 3.2. Technologies

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum compatibility
- Chart.js for data visualization
- No external dependencies requiring server-side processing
- Responsive design for various device sizes

### 3.3. File Access Methods

- Use client-side File APIs to read local files
- Implement read/cache patterns for better performance
- Provide fallback for loading pre-generated JSON data

## 4. User Flows

### 4.1. Browse Encodings

1. User opens `encoding_browser.html` in browser
2. System loads `index.json` and displays encoding list
3. User can filter, sort, and search encodings
4. User selects an encoding to view details

### 4.2. View Encoding Details

1. User selects an encoding from the list
2. System loads the encoding data and displays metrics
3. User views visualizations and detailed information
4. User can access related reports or compare with other encodings

### 4.3. Compare Encodings

1. User selects two encodings to compare
2. System loads both encodings and displays side-by-side comparison
3. Differences are highlighted and comparative metrics shown
4. User can generate or view HTML comparison reports

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. **Create Base HTML Templates**
   - Design responsive layouts for all three views
   - Implement consistent header, navigation, and styling

2. **Develop JavaScript Utilities**
   - File loading and parsing utilities
   - Data transformation and processing functions
   - Chart generation and configuration utilities

3. **Implement Dashboard View**
   - Create responsive encoding list with filtering/sorting
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add selected encoding highlighting

4. **Implement Detail View**
   - Create visualization components for metrics
   - Implement job description alignment display
   - Add report access and comparison selection

5. **Implement Comparison View**
   - Create side-by-side visualization components
   - Implement difference highlighting
   - Add report generation/viewing integration

6. **Integration with Existing Components**
   - Ensure compatibility with report generation
   - Update directory structure for web components
   - Add links from reports to web interface

## 6. Testing Plan

1. Test file loading across different browsers
2. Verify visualization correctness with sample data
3. Test responsiveness on various device sizes
4. Verify integration with existing reports

## 7. Extension Points

1. **Future Enhancement: PowerShell Integration**
   - Add PowerShell command to launch browser interface
   - Create update mechanism for web interface components

2. **Future Enhancement: Resume Editing**
   - Add capability to suggest resume edits based on JD alignment
   - Create edit preview and download functionality
