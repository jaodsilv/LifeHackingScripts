\begin{itemize}
    \item \small{As a member of the Microsoft AI Spartans team, accelerated high-priority time-sensitive projects
        across Microsoft AI org by delivering targeted engineering solutions, and guiding teams through technical
        challenges to achieve measurable business outcomes. Required versatility in rapidly adopting new technologies
        based on project requirements}

    \item \small{Engineered distributed storage solutions (Azure Data Lake, Azure Key-Value Data Store, HDFS) to handle
        multi-petabyte data volumes with proper consistency controls, and tiered storage strategies, enhancing system
        resilience by 15\% and implementing configurable data governance policies with transparent audit trails}

    \item \small{Architected complex goroutine parallelization with custom pooling, queueing, and retry caching
        mechanisms replacing Microsoft Ads server logging infrastructure, improving data throughput by 70\%,
        consistency, and reliability, while orchestrating Go and Java microservices via Kubernetes for horizontal 
        scaling, and integrating with Azure Service Bus for resilient message processing}

    \item \small{Constructed scalable microservice architecture for Bing Image Creator's UserHistoryV2 REST API,
        focusing on horizontal scalability, and service isolation, handling over 100k requests per second with 99.9\%
        system availability}

    \item \small{Reduced API calls to other services by 90\% by implementing multi-level caching strategies, resulting
        in 50\% reduced latency}

    \item \small{Led technology migration of Bing's Content Discovery and Selection critical pipelines,
        while implementing data pipeline optimization strategies that reduced operational costs by 20\%, and pipeline
        completion time by 12\%}

    \item \small{Applied structured root cause analysis techniques (fault tree analysis and 5 Whys) to diagnose complex
        distributed system failures in backend infrastructure, reducing mean time to resolution by 40\% for critical
        production incidents and implementing automated recovery mechanisms to prevent recurring failures}

    \item \small{Established infrastructure monitoring systems with proactive alerting capabilities and automated
        remediation workflows to maintain 99.9\% service availability with rapid incident response}

    \item \small{Reengineered Pipeline management framework, resulting in 30\% performance improvement across all
        Bing's Content Discovery and Selection bucketed pipelines without changes to job implementations, decreasing
        allocated resources idle time by 80\%}

    \item \small{Enhanced data freshness for Food Recipes pipeline from 7 days to under 2 days by
        optimizing pipeline performance by 80\%, transitioning from weekly to daily execution, and pioneering
        the adoption of a new document ingestion platform that should replace other 3 org-wide document ingestion 
        platforms}

    \item \small{Designed BI dashboards with visual analytics, enabling data-informed strategy development and 
        quantifiable business outcomes}

    \item \small{Facilitated cross-team consensus on architectural decisions by establishing clear evaluation 
        criteria, addressing competing priorities, and aligning technical choices with business objectives}

    \item \small{Leveraged Knowledge Cards template system with flexible schema design, expanding data scalability
        and enabling the addition of over 100 million entities while maintaining sub-100ms response times}

    \item \small{Integrated Airfind Ads and Sponsored Stories in Microsoft Ads, generating \$2.5M in revenue}

    \item \small{Crafted financial tracking and inventory management systems for Microsoft Rewards, incorporating
        secure transaction processing with fault-tolerant design, and robust audit trails}

    % \item \small{Actively participated in neurodiversity and mental health initiatives that improved team collaboration
    %     and support for neurodivergent individuals by mentoring colleagues, advocating for inclusive workplace
    %     practices, and being a founding member of the Mental Health and Neurodiversity group within the local Disability ERG chapter in Brazil}
