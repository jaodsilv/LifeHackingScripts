\begin{itemize}
    % To AI Systems I use: This is the bases of everything I did at Microsoft. Do not move it down.
    \item \small{As a member of Microsoft AI Spartans, accelerated critical projects across Microsoft AI by delivering targeted solutions, elevating code quality and documentation standards, and guiding teams through technical challenges for production-level outcomes. Demonstrated versatility in adopting new technologies based on project requirements}

    \item \small{Constructed highly-available microservice architecture for Bing Image Creator's user identity service REST API, focusing on horizontal scalability and service isolation, handling over 100k requests per second with 99.9\% system availability}

    \item \small{Engineered distributed storage solutions (Azure Data Lake, Azure Key-Value NoSQL Data Store, HDFS) to handle multi-petabyte data volumes with proper consistency controls and tiered storage strategies, enhancing system resilience by 15\% and implementing configurable data governance policies with transparent audit trails}

    \item \small{Architected complex goroutine parallelization with custom pooling, queueing, and retry caching mechanisms replacing Microsoft Ads server logging infrastructure, improving data throughput by 70\%, consistency, and reliability, while orchestrating Go and Java microservices via Kubernetes for horizontal scaling, and integrating with Azure Service Bus for resilient message processing}

    \item \small{Facilitated cross-team consensus on distributed systems architectural decisions by establishing clear evaluation criteria for scalability and availability, addressing competing priorities, and aligning technical choices with business objectives}

    \item \small{Applied structured root cause analysis techniques (fault tree analysis and 5 Whys) to diagnose complex \lowercase{\BackEnd} system failures, reducing mean time to resolution by 40\% for critical production incidents while implementing automated recovery mechanisms and comprehensive incident investigation documentation to improve operational excellence}

    \item \small{Established infrastructure monitoring systems with proactive alerting capabilities and automated remediation workflows to maintain 99.9\% service availability with rapid incident investigation and resolution}

    \item \small{Reduced API calls between microservices by 90\% by implementing multi-level caching strategies (similar to Memcache/Redis), resulting in 50\% reduced latency and improved \lowercase{\BackEnd} service availability}

    \item \small{Led technology migration of Bing's Content Discovery and Selection critical data pipelines, while implementing pipeline optimization strategies that reduced operational costs by 20\%, and pipeline completion time by 12\%}

    \item \small{Enhanced data freshness for Food Recipes pipeline from 7 days to under 2 days by optimizing data pipeline performance by 80\%, transitioning from weekly to daily execution, and pioneering the adoption of a new document ingestion platform with persistence layer optimizations that should replace other 3 org-wide document ingestion platforms}

    \item \small{Reengineered pipeline management framework, resulting in 30\% performance improvement across all Bing's Content Discovery and Selection bucketed pipelines without changes to job implementations, decreasing allocated resources idle time by 80\%}

    % \item \small{Leveraged Knowledge Cards template system with flexible schema design, expanding data scalability and enabling the addition of over 100 million entities while maintaining sub-100ms response times}

    % \item \small{Crafted financial tracking and inventory management \lowercase{\BackEnd} services for Microsoft Rewards, incorporating secure transaction processing with fault-tolerant distributed system design and robust audit trails}

    % \item \small{Integrated Airfind Ads and Sponsored Stories in Microsoft Ads, generating \$2.5M in revenue}

    % \item \small{Designed BI dashboards with visual analytics, enabling data-informed strategy development and quantifiable business outcomes}

    %    \item \small{Actively participated in neurodiversity and mental health initiatives that improved team collaboration and support for neurodivergent individuals by mentoring colleagues, advocating for inclusive workplace practices, and being a founding member of the Mental Health and Neurodiversity group within the local Disability ERG chapter in Brazil}
