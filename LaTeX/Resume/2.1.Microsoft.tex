\begin{itemize}
    \item \small{As a member of the Spartans team, accelerated high-priority time-sensitive
        projects across Microsoft AI org by delivering targeted engineering solutions, and guiding teams
        through technical challenges to achieve measurable business outcomes. Required versatility 
        in rapidly adopting new technologies based on project requirements}

    \item \small{Facilitated cross-team consensus on architectural decisions by establishing clear 
        evaluation criteria, addressing competing priorities, and aligning technical choices with 
        business objectives}

    \item \small{Engineered distributed storage solutions (Azure Data Lake, Azure Key-Value Data Store 
        and HDFS) to handle multi-petabyte data volumes with proper consistency controls, and tiered
        storage strategies for enhancing system resilience and data governance}

    \item \small{Applied structured root cause analysis techniques (fault tree analysis and 5
        Whys) to diagnose complex distributed system failures, reducing mean time to resolution by 40\%
        for critical production incidents}

    \item \small{Led the migration of Bing's Content Discovery and Selection critical offline
        pipelines from Cosmos Scope to Apache Spark, reducing operational costs by 20\% across
        large-scale data platform services while enhancing performance}

    \item \small{Enhanced data freshness for Food Recipes pipeline from 7 days to under 2 days by
        optimizing pipeline performance by 80\%, transitioning from weekly to daily execution, and being 
        the first project to adopt a new document ingestion platform}

    \item \small{Reengineered Pipeline management framework, resulting in 30\% performance
        improvement across all Bing's Content Discovery and Selection bucketed pipelines without
        requiring modification to job implementations}

    \item \small{Architected complex goroutine parallelization with custom pooling, queueing, and retry 
        caching mechanisms replacing Microsoft Ads logging infrastructure, improving data throughput,
        consistency, and reliability, while orchestrating Go and Java components via Kubernetes, and
        integrating with Azure Service Bus}
    
    \item \small{Constructed microservice architectures for Bing Image Creator's UserHistoryV2 REST 
        API, focusing on low-latency, scalability, and service isolation, handling over 100k requests per 
        second}
    \item \small{Reduced API calls to other services by 90\% through implementation of refined caching strategies}
    
    \item \small{Established monitoring systems with alerting capabilities to maintain 99.9\%
        service availability with rapid incident response}

    % \item \small{Designed BI dashboards that transformed raw data into visual analytics, enabling
    %     data-informed strategy development and quantifiable business outcomes.}

    \item \small{Integrated Sponsored Stories in Microsoft Ads, generating \$2.5M in revenue for
        high-traffic integrations while ensuring seamless user experience}

    \item \small{Leveraged Knowledge Cards template system with flexible schema design, expanding
        data scalability and enabling the addition of over 100 million entities while maintaining
        sub-100ms response times}

    \item \small{Crafted financial tracking and inventory management systems for Microsoft Rewards
        integration, incorporating secure transaction processing with robust audit trails}
