% ==== OPENING PARAGRAPH ====
I am writing to express my interest in the \POSITION{} position at \COMPANY, which I discovered through \SOURCE. With over nine years of experience building scalable back-end services and high-performance systems at Microsoft and Google, I am particularly drawn to \COMPANY's work on its \PRODUCT{} and believe my technical background makes me well-suited for this role.

% ==== BODY PARAGRAPH 1 - TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ====
At Microsoft's AI Spartans team, I constructed scalable microservice architectures handling over 100k requests per second while maintaining 99.9\% system availability. I've implemented fault-tolerant patterns, observability solutions, and automated alerting for mission-critical systems. My experience includes engineering distributed storage solutions to handle multi-petabyte data volumes with proper consistency controls and configurable governance policies. At Google, I developed streaming pipelines processing 11 billion log entries daily, incorporating advanced sharding and replication patterns that would transfer well to \COMPANY's scaling requirements.

% ==== BODY PARAGRAPH 2 - COLLABORATIVE APPROACH ====
Beyond technical implementation, I excel in cross-team collaboration and prioritize documentation quality and testing excellence. At Microsoft, I facilitated consensus on architectural decisions by establishing clear evaluation criteria and aligning technical choices with business objectives. My approach to system development includes comprehensive test automation, performance profiling, and structured root cause analysis techniques—reducing mean time to resolution for critical production incidents by 40\%. I consistently evaluate existing systems while proposing architecture that can scale for future needs, which I understand is a key responsibility in this role.
