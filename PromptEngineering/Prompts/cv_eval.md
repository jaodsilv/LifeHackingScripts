## What is an ATS-compliant resume?

An ATS-compliant resume is one that can be easily scanned and interpreted by an applicant tracking system (ATS). This means that my resume should be formatted clearly, with relevant keywords included.

## How do I make an ATS-compatible resume?

In order to make an ATS-compatible resume you should format my resume properly by sticking to a simple and structured design that’s easy to read, with clear headings and font type.
Use Enhancv’s ATS-tested and approved resume templates to ensure your resume is seen in full by all the applicant tracking systems.

## What if my resume is not parsed properly?

Recruiters use ATS systems to filter out candidates not matching the requirements of the job offer.
If your resume is not parsed correctly, it means key sections like skills and experience are invisible to the applicant tracking system.
That means there’s a high chance that you won’t get invited to an interview because a recruiter never saw your application in the first place.

# Task

## Content

### ATS Parse Rate
A high parse rate of your resume ensures that the ATS can read your resume, experience, and skills. This increases the chance of getting my resume seen by recruiters.

### Quantifying Impact
Any good resume will show the impact you’ve had in previous positions you’ve held.
Quantifying your impact on your resume is the key to building a strong application that will get recruiters to pick up the phone and invite you to an interview.

### Repetition/Redundancy
Using the same words over and over again in your resume can be perceived as a sign of poor language understanding.

Instead, use synonyms and active verbs that increase the impact of your achievements.

### Spelling & Grammar
Having an error-free resume is key to making a good first impression on the hiring manager. Ensure that your resume is free from spelling and grammatical errors by reading it aloud a few times.

For an extra layer of security, use the Enhancv resume builder and let the content checker do the heavy lifting for you.

## Format
### File Format & Size

When you’re uploading your resume in platforms like Indeed, you’re likely to meet a file size limit. Ideally, your resume should be less than 2MB in size. Anything larger will most likely not be accepted on majority of platforms.

Your file type also plays an important role in ATS screening. PDF files are preferred as the text can be easily read by the applicant tracking system. Avoid DOCX, PNG or JPG files.

### Resume Length
The length of your resume should be based on the relevant experience you have for a job, the number of years of experience, and the job you’re applying for.

For 95% of applicants, a one-page resume is more than enough to communicate relevant information to the hiring manager. For positions in the medical world, expanding the length to accommodate all experiences can be beneficial.

### Long Bullet Points
Using bullet points to communicate experience and achievements on your resume is a sure way to grab the hiring manager’s attention. Bullet points improve the structure of your resume and make your point easily.

That’s why bullet point length is crucial for a good resume. Using no more than 50 words is a must if you want to make your resume easy to read.

#### When is a bullet point considered “too long”?

Most bullet points should be between 20 and 50 words and should consist of relevant and important information. If a bullet is longer than the above it should be shortened or broken into two. With Enhancv PRO you can automatically get a concise version of your bullet points.

## Sections
### Contact Information
What contact information should I include?

It's important that potential employers and recruiters can easily reach you, so ensure you've included your email address at the bare minimum. You can optionally include a mobile number too.

If you have a portfolio website or LinkedIn it makes sense to add it to your resume, so recruiters can see more information about your experience

### Essential Sections
What are the essential sections in a resume?

It’s important to include those three required sections — Experience, Education, and Skills in your resume.
Ensure that they are properly formatted and every single element is clearly outlined (degree, institution, education dates, company names, job titles, employment dates, bullets with responsibilities and achievements, and skills).

### Personality
Why is it good to have a "Books" section on my resume?

Adding a "Books" section on your resume could be beneficial in several ways, but it largely depends on the specific job you're applying for and the types of books you choose to list. Here are a few reasons why it could be helpful:
Demonstrates Continuous Learning: A book list can show that you're committed to lifelong learning and staying updated with industry trends, particularly if you list recent and relevant professional development or industry books.
Showcases Intellectual Curiosity: The books you read can say a lot about your interests and the breadth of your knowledge. It can illustrate a desire to learn beyond your professional field, demonstrating intellectual curiosity.
Reflects your Values and Passions: Books on topics related to the company's mission or values, or the position you're applying for, can show that you're passionate about the same things and align with the company's culture.
Encourages Conversation: It can be a conversation starter in an interview and help you connect on a more personal level with the interviewer.
Shows Good Time Management: If you read a lot, it can demonstrate that you manage your time effectively, as reading often requires commitment and discipline.

Should I have a "Hobbies" or "Passions" section on my resume?
Whether to include a "Hobbies" or "Passions" section on your resume depends on the job you're applying for, your professional experience, and the hobbies or passions themselves. Here are a few considerations:
Relevancy: If your hobbies or passions are relevant to the job you're applying for, they can be valuable to include. For instance, if you're applying for a graphic design role and you love painting in your spare time, this hobby shows creativity and a keen eye for aesthetics.
Transferable Skills: Hobbies can also demonstrate transferable skills. If you run a blog, for example, it can show writing skills, discipline, and an understanding of digital platforms—even if the blog's subject matter is not directly related to your job.
Space: If your resume is already quite full with more relevant information (such as work experience, skills, qualifications, and achievements), it may be better to omit a hobbies section in favor of this more important information.
Personality and Fit: A "Hobbies" or "Passions" section can give employers insight into your personality, potentially showing you'd be a good cultural fit for their team. It can also serve as a conversation starter during an interview.
Leadership and Teamwork: If your hobbies involve teamwork or leadership (like being part of a sports team or leading a book club), this can demonstrate valuable skills that are applicable in many work environments.

## Style
### Design
The design of your resume is crucial. Well-designed resume templates give you the opportunity to communicate information in different ways - graphs, bullets, achievements, and more.
Enhancv resume templates are made with ATS in mind, allowing you to use visually impressive sections that are easily read by applicant tracking systems.

#### What can I do to make my resume stand out?
Most applications use black and white resume template which makes them blend in with the pile of other applicants. By using a visually appealing resume like Enhancv, you make sure your document catches the eye when a recruiter is looking at it.

### Email Address
Emails are important in today’s world. It’s one of the go-to ways for recruiters to get in touch with you, especially if you’re applying for a job that’s remote and in another country.

### Active Voice
Using active voice in your resume can help you fit more information into a single page as active voice tends to be shorter than passive voice sentences.

### Buzzwords & Cliches
Using buzzwords and jargon in your resume is a sure-fire way to lose the interest of recruiters quickly.
Buzzwords make information that should be easily understandable unclear.
