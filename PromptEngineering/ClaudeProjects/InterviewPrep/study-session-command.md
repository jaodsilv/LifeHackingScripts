# `study_session` Command Documentation
SCOPE: project

## Purpose
The `study_session` command initiates a structured learning session focused on a specific topic or subtopic, with configurable duration to fit your schedule. This command generates appropriate learning materials, exercises, and guidance based on a previously generated interview preparation plan.

## Basic Syntax
```
study_session <preparation_plan_name> topic:<topic_name> duration:<minutes> [subtopic:<subtopic_name>] [status:continue] [mode:<learning_mode>] [focus:<skill_focus>]
```

| `preparation_plan_name` | Name of the preparation plan | Yes | `Anthropic` |
| `topic` | Main subject area for study | Yes | `python_fundamentals`, `data_structures`, `refactoring` |
| `duration` | Length of session in minutes | Yes | `30`, `60`, `90`, `120` |
| `subtopic` | Specific focus within main topic | No | `list_comprehensions`, `error_handling` |
| `status` | Continue previous session | No | `continue` |
| `mode` | Learning approach | No | `concept`, `practice`, `interview`, `review`, `mixed` (default: `mixed`) |
| `focus` | Specific skill to emphasize | No | `speed`, `accuracy`, `communication`, `depth` |
| `difficulty` | Challenge level | No | `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, `adaptive` (default: `adaptive`) |
| `materials` | External resources to include | No | `docs`, `videos`, `exercises`, `all` |

## Examples

### Basic usage (2-hour session on Python fundamentals)
```
study_session Anthropic topic:python_fundamentals duration:120
```

### Focused 30-minute session on a specific subtopic
```
study_session Anthropic topic:data_structures subtopic:collections_module duration:30
```

### Continue a previously saved study session
```
study_session Anthropic topic:refactoring subtopic:clean_code duration:60 status:continue
```

### Practice-focused session with high difficulty
```
study_session Anthropic topic:algorithms duration:90 mode:practice difficulty:hard
```

### Interview preparation with communication focus
```
study_session Anthropic topic:system_design duration:60 mode:interview focus:communication
```

### Quick concept review before an interview
```
study_session Anthropic topic:behavioral_questions duration:30 mode:review
```

## Behavior

When executed, the command will:

1. Check if the topic/subtopic combination exists in the preparation plan
2. Retrieve or generate appropriate study materials for the specified topic
3. Structure the session based on the allocated time and selected mode
4. Present materials, exercises, and guidance in order of increasing difficulty
5. Track progress through the session
6. Offer to save your status at the end of the allocated time
7. Provide next steps for continued learning
8. Automatically adjust difficulty based on your performance (if adaptive)
9. Simulate interview conditions when in interview mode
10. Generate personalized practice exercises based on your weak areas

## Learning Modes

### Concept Mode
Focuses on understanding key principles and theory:
- Clear explanations of fundamental concepts
- Visual aids and diagrams
- Real-world examples
- Key terminology and definitions
- Limited practice exercises

### Practice Mode
Emphasizes hands-on problem solving:
- Minimal theory refreshers
- Multiple practice problems
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Solution walkthroughs
- Performance feedback
- Time-constrained exercises

### Interview Mode
Simulates actual interview conditions:
- Realistic time constraints
- Interview-style questions
- Verbal explanation prompts
- On-the-spot problem solving
- Communication guidance
- Interviewer role-playing

### Review Mode
Quick refresher of previously studied material:
- Concise summaries of key points
- Spaced repetition of core concepts
- Targeted mini-exercises
- Common pitfall reminders
- Interview-relevant highlights

### Mixed Mode (Default)
Balanced approach combining multiple modes:
- Concept introduction
- Guided practice
- Interview preparation
- Performance assessment

## Focus Areas

### Speed
- Timed exercises
- Efficient algorithm selection
- Quick problem-solving techniques
- Pattern recognition training

### Accuracy
