## Key Workflow Patterns

### Setting Up Your Study Plan
1. Use `setup_interview_prep` or `setup_study` to create a customized plan
2. Consider your timeline, experience level, and target company
3. Specify focus areas based on job requirements
4. Research current interview patterns with `web_search`
5. Find company-specific information and preparation resources

### Daily Study Routine
1. Start with `study_day` to get an overview of what to focus on
2. Use `study_session` for targeted learning on specific topics
3. Supplement with online resources using `web_search`
4. Record progress with `save_status` including confidence and difficulty
5. End the day with `track_progress` to identify gaps

### External Resources and Collaboration
1. Use `web_search` to find targeted practice problems on platforms like NeetCode, LeetCode, or HackerRank
2. Search for visual explanations and tutorials for difficult concepts
3. Find real-world system design examples and case studies
4. Schedule mock interviews with peers using `schedule_mock_interview`
5. Join online communities for additional support and practice partners
6. Research company-specific interview patterns and questions

### Weekly Review and Adjustment
1. Use `track_progress compare:week_start` to see your progress
2. Focus on weak areas identified by confidence and priority ratings
3. Schedule mock interviews with `interview_roleplay` or `schedule_mock_interview`
4. Apply feedback with `feedback_integration`
5. Search for additional resources on challenging topics

### Pre-Interview Final Preparation
1. Use `recruiter_call_prep` before initial calls
2. Run final `interview_roleplay` sessions for realistic practice
3. Schedule last-minute mock interviews with available peers
4. Review your `track_progress` to ensure comprehensive coverage
5. Create customized study sessions for last-minute focus areas
6. Research latest company news and initiatives

### Emergency Preparation Strategies
1. Focus exclusively on highest-impact topics for your specific interview
2. Spend more time on practice than concept learning
3. Use multiple short mock interviews rather than fewer long ones
4. Leverage the `intensity:intensive` option in setup commands
5. Focus on communication skills as much as technical knowledge
6. Use the `mode:interview` parameter early to simulate pressure
7. Use `web_search` to find the most relevant and recent practice problems
8. Schedule urgent mock interviews with available peers or mentors

## Time Management Tips

- For intensive preparation, allocate 3-4 hours daily
- For working professionals, use the `weekends_focus` study pattern
- Use the `time_available` parameter to optimize limited study time
- Schedule regular short review sessions for spaced repetition
- Prioritize topics marked with high priority and low confidence
- Include mock interviews at least once per week
- Balance concept learning with practical exercises
- For emergency prep, focus 60% on practice, 20% on concepts, and 20% on mock interviews
- Supplement study with targeted online resources like NeetCode, LeetCode, and company-specific guides
- Schedule mock interviews with different people to get diverse feedback

## Resource Integration Recommendations

### Online Coding Platforms
- NeetCode: Organized by patterns and companies, great for targeted practice
- LeetCode: Comprehensive problem set with company tags
- HackerRank: Good for timed practice sessions
- AlgoExpert: For detailed video explanations of algorithms

### System Design Resources
- System Design Primer (GitHub)
- Grokking the System Design Interview
- Company engineering blogs for real-world architectures
- YouTube channels with system design case studies

### Mock Interview Platforms
- Pramp: Free peer-to-peer technical interviews
- interviewing.io: Practice with professionals
- Peer groups from bootcamps or universities
- Former colleagues at target companies

### Company Research
- Glassdoor: For interview experiences and questions
- Blind: For recent interview trends
- LinkedIn: For connecting with current employees
- Company tech blogs and GitHub repositories

This workflow guide demonstrates how to leverage the Interview Preparation system's commands effectively for comprehensive interview preparation across different scenarios and constraints.
